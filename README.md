[*SparkFun FTDI Basic Breakout-5V(DEV-09716)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9716)

This is a basic breakout board for the FTDI FT232RL USB to serial IC. 
The pinout of this board matches the FTDI cable to work with official Arduino and cloned Arduino boards. 
It can also be used for general serial applications. The major difference with this board is that it brings out the DTR pin as opposed to the RTS pin of the FTDI cable. 
The DTR pin allows an Arduino target to auto-reset when a new Sketch is downloaded. This is a really nice feature to have and allows a sketch to be downloaded without having to hit the reset button. 
This board will auto reset any Arduino board that has the reset pin brought out to a 6-pin connector.
